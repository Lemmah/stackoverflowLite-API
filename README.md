# stackoverflowLite-API
A REST API that mimics stackoverflow for asking and answering questions. This is a [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) course on [Build a REST API with Express](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-rest-api-with-express).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
- Just clone this repository by typing: `git clone https://github.com/Lemmah/stackoverflowLite-API.git`
- Switch to project directory: `cd stackoverflowLite-API`
- Install packages by running `npm install`. Wait, you have to have some stuff before you get to this point. So these are:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v8.12.0 and above.
- Npm for package management, this comes with node.
Just type:
```
node -v
```
in your terminal and if its not greater than or equal to v8.12.0, you're not in big trouble, there are tons of tutorials to get up up and running with these. Just grub one then come back when done.

### Installing

All packages are installed by `npm install`.
Run `npm run serve` to view the application. Visit `localhost:3000`


## Running the tests

This app has no tests, it's just for learning purposes.
